# Chain Explorer

The chain explorer is the primary interface in the [pruv dashboard](https://app.pruv.dev) for inspecting verification chains. It shows every action as a visual timeline, lets you expand entries for detail, and displays alerts inline.

## Accessing the Explorer

1. Sign in at [app.pruv.dev](https://app.pruv.dev)
2. Navigate to **Chains** in the sidebar
3. Click any chain to open the explorer

Or go directly to `https://app.pruv.dev/chains/{chain_id}`.

## Timeline View

The chain explorer displays entries as a vertical timeline. Each entry shows:

- **Sequence number** — Position in the chain
- **Operation name** — What action was performed (e.g., `send_email`, `tool.start`)
- **Timestamp** — When the action occurred
- **Status** — Success, failed, or pending
- **Verification badge** — Green checkmark if the entry's hash is valid

Entries are connected by a vertical line. The line represents the cryptographic link between entries — each entry's `x` equals the previous entry's `y`.

## Entry Detail

Click any entry in the timeline to expand its details:

- **X hash** — Hash of the state before the action
- **Y hash** — Hash of the state after the action
- **XY proof** — The combined proof hash
- **State data** — The actual before/after state (if stored)
- **Signature** — Ed25519 signature and signer ID (if signed)
- **Metadata** — Any custom metadata attached to the entry

## Verification

The explorer runs verification automatically when you open a chain. The verification status appears at the top:

- **Verified** — Every entry's hash is valid, every link is intact
- **Break detected** — The chain broke at a specific entry. The break point is highlighted in red in the timeline.

You can also manually re-verify by clicking the **Verify** button.

## Alerts

If alerts exist for the chain, they appear as a summary banner at the top of the explorer:

- **Critical** alerts show in red with a count badge
- **Warning** alerts show in yellow
- **Info** alerts show in blue

Click the alert banner to see full details. Alerts with an `entry_id` link directly to the entry that triggered them in the timeline.

## Time Travel

Use the time travel slider to view the chain at any point in its history:

1. Open the time travel panel (clock icon)
2. Drag the slider to a specific entry
3. The timeline shows only entries up to that point
4. Verification runs on the partial chain

This is useful for investigating when a problem first appeared or understanding the sequence of events leading to an issue.

## Export

Export chains from the explorer:

- **HTML** — Self-verifying HTML file. Anyone can open it in a browser and verify the chain independently, without a pruv account.
- **PDF** — Formatted receipt document suitable for compliance records or stakeholder reports.
- **JSON** — Raw chain data for programmatic processing.

Click the **Export** button in the explorer toolbar to choose a format.

## Checkpoints

If checkpoints exist for the chain, they appear as markers on the timeline. Click a checkpoint to:

- **Preview** — See the state snapshot at that point
- **Compare** — Diff the checkpoint state against the current state
- **Restore** — Roll back to that checkpoint (requires confirmation)
