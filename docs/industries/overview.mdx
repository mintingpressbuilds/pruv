# Industries

pruv's cryptographic verification works across any domain where you need to prove what happened. The XY primitive is domain-agnostic -- it captures state transitions regardless of what those states represent.

## Why Industries Need Verification

Every industry has processes where trust matters:
- Did the AI agent actually run the right tests before deploying?
- Was the financial transaction authorized by the right people?
- Were patient records modified by an authorized clinician?
- Did the supply chain maintain proper custody?

Traditional solutions rely on logs, which can be edited or deleted. pruv creates **tamper-evident, cryptographically linked** records that cannot be altered without detection.

## Common Patterns Across Industries

### 1. Audit Trail

Every industry needs to answer "what happened and when?" pruv chains provide a complete, ordered, tamper-evident history.

```python
chain = XYChain(name="audit-trail")
chain.append("action-1", y_state={...}, private_key=key, signer_id="user@org")
chain.append("action-2", y_state={...}, private_key=key, signer_id="user@org")
# ...
valid, _ = chain.verify()
```

### 2. Multi-Party Verification

When multiple parties need to trust each other, shared chains provide a common source of truth:

```python
# Party A signs their action
chain.append("handoff", y_state={...}, private_key=party_a_key, signer_id="party-a")

# Party B signs their acceptance
chain.append("accept", y_state={...}, private_key=party_b_key, signer_id="party-b")

# Both can verify the chain independently
valid, _ = chain.verify()
sigs_valid, _ = chain.verify_signatures()
```

### 3. Compliance Reporting

Generate receipts for compliance officers and auditors:

```python
receipt = XYReceipt(...)
print(f"Verified: {receipt.all_verified}")
print(f"Receipt hash: {receipt.hash}")
# Share the receipt hash as proof of verified work
```
